---pasos para crear vagrant VM-----

----Ansible----
on host machine (not vm)
install ansible - PIP INSTALL ANSIBLE
Create Ansible cookbook - site.yml

---enable vagrant provision for Ansible---
on site.yml automate nvm, updates.. the steps above. These are declared from the varant file and
show when u issue vagrant provision (as vm is up)
Provisioned steps for installing NPM and hav the app running.
I had to provide full permissions to all users in the app folder for npm to work. i need to add the vagrant user with full recursive permissions over that directory. since the become method used in the playbook changed the permissions in the folder

---Automating the application deployment---
Currently, a service is running our application through a script, in time-off-mgmt, script.sh
And a service have been configured to run it. (appdeploy.service)
